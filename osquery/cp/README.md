# OSQuery Python Extension and Confluent Platform

This is an example of how to use [OSQuery's Extensions](https://osquery.readthedocs.io/en/stable/deployment/extensions/) to send OSQuery results to Confluent Platform.

## OSQuery

To run `osqueryd` with the provided python extension, run the following command.

```bash
OSQURY_CONFIG=cp.json osqueryd --extension /confluent.ext --logger_plugin=confluent_logger --config_plugin=osquery_confluent_config
```

OSQuery has 3 command line tools:

* osqueryd - the daemon that runs queries in the background
* osqueryi - a cli to execute queries and display them in std out
* osqueryctl - that controls the osqueryd process

The configration below is passed to osqueryd. Create a file called `config.json` and past the config below.

```json

```

* `options` - holds the kafka configuration parameters. TLS is also supported. See the Kafka producer documentation in OSQuery for instructions.

### Executing osqueryd

```bash
osqueryd --config_path=/project/osquery/config.json --logger_plugin=kafka_producer
```

* `--config_path` is the path to the configuration above.
* `--logger_plugin` instructs osquery to use the Kafka Producer when serializing the logs.

## Docker compose commands

```bash
# builds the containers
make build

# starts the cluster
make cluster

# wait 30 sec for cluster to start
```

Proceed to localhost:9021 to view the Confluent Control Center. Naviate to the topics page and view the topics auto created by OSQuery. Specifically, you can view the incoming messages for the Processes topic which shows a stream if processes running on a host.
